2. Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?
Ans: No, HTML tags and HTML elements are related, but they are not the same thing.

Tags are the building blocks of an element.
Elements are the combination of the tag(s) and the content, representing a part of the HTML document's structure.
The tag is the name of the element, and the content is the information that the element contains.
