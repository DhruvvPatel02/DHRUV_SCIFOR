3. What are the tags and attributes in HTML?
Ans: HTML tags are represented by a set of characters surrounded by angle brackets (<>) and usually come in pairs, with the opening tag preceding the content and the closing tag following the content.
Ex: Headings: <h1> to <h6>
    Paragraphs: <p>
    Links: <a>
    Images: <img>
    Lists: <ul>, <ol>, <li>
    Containers: <div>, <span>
HTML attributes provide additional information about the elements. They are added to the opening tag of an element and consist of a name and a value.
Ex: href: specifies the URL of a link
    src: specifies the URL of an image
    alt: specifies the alternative text for an image
    title: specifies the title of a page or an element
    style: specifies the CSS styles for an element
