                        <p>
                            Located in Egypt, the Great Pyramid is the only original wonder
                            still standing. The largest of the three Pyramids of Giza, the
                            Great Pyramid held the distinction of being one of the tallest
                            buildings ever built for nearly 4,000 years.

                      <p>
                        Holding the title of “longest human-made structure in the
                        world,” the Great Wall is actually many walls running through
                        northern China and southern Mongolia. One significant stretch is
                        particularly well preserved and is the part that most of us
                        visit today. The section running from Mount Hu in Liaoning
                        province to Jiayu Pass in Gansu province is 5,500 miles long, up
                        to 21 feet wide, and nearly 33 feet tall at its highest point.

                      <h5>Machu Picchu</h5>
                      <p>
                        Sometimes called the Lost City of the Incas, Machu Picchu is
                        thought to have been a royal retreat for the Incas in the 15th
                        century before it was mysteriously abandoned. Because it’s
                        nestled in the Andes Mountains between two peaks, Machu Picchu
                        went largely unnoticed by European and American explorers for
                        about 400 years. Since its rediscovery, Machu Picchu has brought
                        millions of tourists from all over the world to Peru. The Sun
                        Gate and Temple of the Sun serve as relics of one of the world’s
                        first great civilizations.
